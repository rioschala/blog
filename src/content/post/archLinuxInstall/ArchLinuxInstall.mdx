When installing a new OS, it is relevant to consider all the little details and the fine print it comes with. That is why I will try to install Arc Linux, as an attempt to learn more about Linux (distros) and commands. I will be documenting all the commands used into the terminal. Plus, I will add if possible all pictures and elements this post needs. 

I followed this tutorial, but I will provide information on what the commands do ([Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naVqseLsGqM)). I did also followed the official guide to install: [archlinux Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)  

First, create the virtual machine:

The first Element I encountered is that the time and date were out of sync in the system (remember everything is being done on a virtual machine). After some research, I found out that it is not essential to run that command in the first place since it can be achieved later on. [^1]

Once keyboard layout was configured using ```loadkeys es``` and we were able to connect to the internet, it's time to start installing some packages that will be used later on in the system.

Once a connection to the internet is stablished, now ```timedatecrtl``` provides a synced device result.

After multiple commands (see pictures), I was not able to properly install Arch, it constantly kept showing error messages and booting into the **.ISO**

At the very end, I decided to use ```archinstall``` command following the next code:


> execute ```pacman -Sy archinstall``` (per the developer), to get the latest and most bug free release; then execute ```archinstall```.
