This blog is a space for sharing insights, resources, and reflections on Computer Science, with a particular focus on the IGCSE 0478 and IB CS SL curricula. To maintain clarity, integrity, and respect for all readers, the following principles guide all published content and community interactions:
1. Accuracy and Clarity
Content will strive to be factually accurate, relevant to the syllabus, and clearly explained. Any updates or corrections will be made transparently.
2. Attribution and Sources
When using or referencing external resources (books, articles, websites, tools), proper credit will be given. Original work and ideas will be clearly distinguished from sourced material.
3. Respectful Discourse
Comments and interactions (if enabled) must remain respectful, constructive, and relevant. Personal attacks, spam, and off-topic discussions will not be tolerated.
4. Educational Purpose
All content aims to support students, educators, and enthusiasts in understanding and applying Computer Science concepts. The blog does not replace formal instruction but supplements learning with curated insights.
5. Transparency
Any affiliations, sponsorships, or conflicts of interest (e.g., tool reviews or promoted resources) will be disclosed.
6. Inclusivity and Accessibility
Efforts will be made to use inclusive language and provide accessible explanations for diverse learners, including those new to programming or formal computer science.
7. Feedback and Improvement
Constructive feedback is welcome and encouraged. The blog is a living resource that evolves based on reflection and community input.
