This is the price of specialization. There is no escaping it.

good generalist is just a short-term specialist. Mark it down.

This principle requires context, and just about any skill or technique can be validated by it so long as you’re clear on what you want to achieve and what’s needed to achieve it.

Specialists try to be the best at something so they can get enough attention for somebody to scoop them up and offer them a contract of some kind—they end up being dependent on somebody else. Generalists, however, acquire whatever skills they need so they can be successful entirely on their own. That, my little rabbit, is the secret to sweet, sweet freedom.

shape. See how that works? As a generalist, you always win, so long as you know what to compete in.

It’s that little sacrifice in the short term that allows for considerable progress in the long term. That’s Short-Term Specialization.

would think. The point is that you have to be OK with letting some areas develop more slowly as you surge in the area you most want to improve.

This reminded me of when I was a younger tae kwon do student. Som told me that while there are a thousand and one kicks, you need to know only about five to ten to be a competitor—

Get the basics down. Stick to the fundamentals.”

But the principle also states that we should practice the skill as best as possible within the context of the goal we want to achieve.

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 5:22:22 PM

even if we aren’t able to integrate right away, our goal is to integrate as soon as possible and to practice only the skills that we will integrate.

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 5:22:38 PM

And just to be clear on our terms: to integrate means to perform something within the context that it is intended to be in, and to isolate means to extract something and practice it on its own so you can get it up to speed.

When you need a word, find it. But don’t spend all your time finding words you don’t need.

Part of the reason people don’t progress (in the gym or otherwise) is that they’re doing reps but not adding weight.

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 5:49:24 PM

Repetition will get you only so far. If you want to get stronger, you need to add “weight” to whatever you’re doing.

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 5:49:54 PM

It’s not enough to merely practice what you’re already good at; you have to practice the things that strain your capabilities—the things that you’re not already good at it.

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 5:51:09 PM

the same time, however, you should never give yourself permission to slack on quality just because the assignment is difficult.

“Challenged but successful.”

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 5:54:08 PM

writing sentences, whatever it is. Occasionally you may exceed your limits (that’s called “strategic overreach”), and that’s not always a bad thing, but it can be a bad thing if that’s all you’re doing. Challenged but successful. Challenged but successful. Challenged but successful.

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 5:54:36 PM

You can’t add weight to something you’re not doing—or something you’re not already familiar with—and that’s the point of repetition:

Freedom comes in knowing and making and doing good things,

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 6:36:00 PM

Discipline, in other words, equals freedom—the freedom to express yourself, the freedom to do good things and make good things, and to know what good things are.

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 6:37:08 PM

That’s all logic is: thinking done right and done well.

Short-Term Specialization, the Rule of 80 Percent, Integration > Isolation, Repetition and Resistance, and, what’s that other one again?—ah yes, Skill Stacking > Specialization.

the person who chooses to not do whatever they want. Freedom is found in restriction, restriction that leads to the practice of something useful.

Pain is the only way out.

if you want to invoke the muse, you have to show that you are worthy of handling what she gives you,

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 6:48:40 PM

This means that you need to get better at showing up for whatever you want to get better

The only thing that isn’t hard to finish is sex.

Discipline Equals Freedom: Field Manual (Jocko Willink).

Focus is the skill that lets us do the work once we’ve got the discipline to show.

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 6:53:47 PM

The losers procrastinate. They get distracted. They stop before the job is done. And that’s it. Now, part of that is discipline; the other part is focus.

It’s the reason there’s never a good time to start a diet plan, write a book, or pick up a musical instrument, and it’s the reason there never will be.

Come, Let Us Reason: An Introduction to Logical Thinking

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 7:04:47 PM

Logic, put frankly, is life’s foolproof bullshit detector.

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 7:05:35 PM

To think clearly is to write clearly—or at least to have the potential to.

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 7:06:59 PM

good debate involves knowing not only your position but the opposite, as well.

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 7:08:59 PM

mustn’t let what we want to be true determine our beliefs about what actually is true.

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 7:10:03 PM

An argument is merely presenting reasons for assuming that a position is true and making those reasons as convincing as possible,

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 7:13:09 PM

People are attracted to those who have something to say and who apparently believe in that something. And if you have something to say, people are going to either agree with you or disagree with you.

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 7:14:30 PM

You simply can’t go through life worried about who you’re going to upset with your beliefs.

---

Date: Wednesday, December 25, 2024 7:15:22 PM

Instead of worrying, go through life getting clear on your beliefs and the reasons you adhere to them, and then speak.

---

Date: Thursday, December 26, 2024 12:07:37 AM

Boldness is a lost attribute in today’s society. People are so afraid to speak up about things.

Persuasion, I repeat, is not about flipping a person’s opinion. It’s about confirming

---

Date: Thursday, December 26, 2024 12:09:17 AM

The purpose of the argument might be not to convince the person you’re arguing against but to impress whoever’s in the audience.

---

Date: Thursday, December 26, 2024 12:11:06 AM

Because when you confirm a bias (like a love for kettlebells) and then say how that bias can further a person in some meaningful, productive way, you’ll probably have that person begging to do business with you.

Date: Thursday, December 26, 2024 12:12:00 AM

trying to show how that idea can be developed. That is persuasion.

Faith, in other words, is simply trusting in that which you have good reason to believe. Many

you want to do something, you’re going to find the time to do it. This isn’t a question about making time or scheduling or anything

Aristotle also taught us that living well means focusing ourselves around certain interests, developing virtue, and—most important—seeking the good.

It is impossible for any created good to constitute man’s happiness. For happiness is that perfect good which entirely

It is impossible for any created good to constitute man’s happiness.

In other words, make a lot of money if you want, but don’t do it only for yourself. In fact, you should probably give most of it away if that’s the case.

---

Date: Thursday, December 26, 2024 3:26:30 PM

Happiness is found in exactly what Aristotle says—doing and knowing and making good things.

---

Date: Thursday, December 26, 2024 3:26:49 PM

It’s more “happy in the sense of flourishing and fulfillment” (eudaimonia is the word in Greek to describe this), and that can only happen over time.

---

Date: Thursday, December 26, 2024 3:28:49 PM

Practice the techniques you need to learn in order to do the things you want to do, and practice them in a context that is as close as possible to the context in which they’ll be performed.

---

Date: Thursday, December 26, 2024 3:32:02 PM

Don’t make things harder without making them relevant, in other words.

---

Date: Friday, December 27, 2024 12:28:21 AM

People will do what they think is best in order to get the things they want—whether they are right or not is another story.

Almost everybody has a problem that somebody with a particular skill has the power to solve—

Selling focuses more on specifics, like how to price goods or services and how to position yourself in a specific market or environment.

Date: Friday, December 27, 2024 12:35:03 AM

sometimes you use one skill (or subset of a skill) to subsidize another.

how you can adapt—it’s how you can use a skill stack to provide value in one area and fulfill your life’s purpose in another.

People like hearing about the history of things.

It starts with enjoyment and wanting to help people and know things.

Date: Friday, December 27, 2024 12:41:58 AM

metaskills, interest skills, and need-based skills.

---

Date: Friday, December 27, 2024 12:42:43 AM

If people fail to produce outcomes, it’s because they fail to adhere to process. And they fail to adhere to process because they don’t enjoy it—they do it for the wrong reasons.

---

Date: Friday, December 27, 2024 12:42:56 AM

This isn’t a matter of time. It’s a matter of priority.

---

Date: Friday, December 27, 2024 12:45:06 AM

you think it’s hard to figure out, you’re probably just being lazy.

so-called low-information diet approach, in which you willfully limit the amount of time you spend acquiring information about something, (hopefully) forcing yourself to spend more time implementing the information you already have. (Again, Integration > Isolation.)

“Listen, my little iguana, the problem isn’t that you don’t have enough information; the problem is you don’t know how to take action on the information you do have.”

---

Date: Friday, December 27, 2024 12:48:06 AM

Be a minimalist. Start with the fundamentals, and take action as early as you can.

---

Date: Friday, December 27, 2024 12:50:27 AM

Start with a clear vision of the end, restrict the amount of time you give yourself to arrive, apply the principles of generalism, and get to work.

The greatest tragedy in life would be to live a very long period and catch no horrendous diseases, but to miss the very meaning of life itself,
