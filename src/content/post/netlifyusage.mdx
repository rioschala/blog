This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), a modern static site generator optimised for speed and content-focused experiences. It allows me to write posts using MDX and combine them with interactive components where needed â€” without sacrificing performance.

Deployment is handled by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), which provides a seamless workflow for continuous deployment. Any time I push changes to my GitHub repository, the site is automatically rebuilt and redeployed.

Netlify also manages SSL certificates, asset optimisation, and CDN distribution, ensuring fast and secure access to the blog for everyone.

If you are thinking about building a personal site or content-driven project, the Astro + Netlify stack is lightweight, efficient, and highly customisable.



If you're considering building a blog or personal site, this stack offers a robust and efficient starting point.
