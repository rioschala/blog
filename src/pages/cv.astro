								I earned a <strong style="color:green;">Ser Pilo Paga 2</strong> scholarship for both my under and post graduate studies. It was a government-funded scholarship program in Colombia aimed at supporting high-achieving students from low-income backgrounds. This initiative provided financial assistance to cover tuition fees at accredited universities for students who demonstrated exceptional academic performance and faced economic barriers to accessing higher education. The program was designed to promote educational equity and give talented students the opportunity to pursue higher education without financial constraints.

post conflict areas in the country.
