			Welcome to this blog where I post tools and thoughts. You can feel free to explore my posts and to develop from there. This is, moreover, an adventure of mine when it comes to learning. I need to show and organize different ideas from multiple disciplines. I created this blog using ðŸŒµ Cactus Astro.
